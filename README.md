# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple React application that lets you play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It also indicates when a player has won the game, stores a game's history as it progresses, and allows players to review a game's history and see previous versions of the game's board.

## How to Use

To use the application, simply clone or download this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## How to Play

To start playing Tic-Tac-Toe, simply click on any empty square on the board to make a move. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. If neither player gets three in a row, the game is a tie.

After a game is complete, you can review the game's history by clicking on the "Go to Move #" buttons on the right-hand side of the screen. This will show you the previous versions of the game's board.

## Technologies Used
